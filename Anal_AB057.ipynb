    "### 0. Preprocessing the data\n",
    "The goal of preprocessing is to load the data recorded by the Axon Instruments software, perform the action potential detection and save it in a way that it can be loaded into the behavioral analysis routines. The only problematic part is the spike detection, since the baseline voltage fluctuates a lot and AP amplitudes are not very high, so the amplitudes are comparable to the baseline fluctuations. These fluctuation can be removed by a high pass filter, still the amplitude of the high frequency noise can be similar to the amplitude of the APs. Therefore this step can not be fully automatized. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case I did the preprocessing using custom-written python scripts that seemed to work fine for this particular recording. The plan is that Bazsi will write a program that allows Berci to change the parameters of the voltage filter and the threshold of the spike detection to best match the particular recording session. This will be the same program as the one that saves the behavioral and the e-phys data in igor-compatible format. I also downsampled the original recordings from 50 000 Hz to 5000 Hz - this should be fine for most of the analysis we want to implement here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Load the necessary object class\n",
    "To analyse spatial tuning of the recorded cells we use the same program as we use for the *in vivo* imaging data. The name of the functions reflect their primary usage for imaging. The main difference here is that \n",
    "1. We have higher time resolution voltage recording instead of the fluorescence signal.\n",
    "2. For spikes, we have the actual spike times and not just spike probabilities or inferred spike times\n",
    "3. When we calculate spatial tuning we use the original, 5000 Hz temporal resolution. However, when I calculate shuffling I downsample all data to 50 Hz, and compare the actual data with the shuffled at this, lower resolution. This is mainly due to a memory issue: Shuffling the spike data recorded at 5000 Hz for 300 s (1e6 datapoint) with 1000 shuffles is 1e9 datapoints is a few GB array even for a single neuron. Storing such large array in memory could slow down the calculation. \n",

    "We use a custom-made class, ImagingSessionData, that will contain all behavioral and imaging data"
